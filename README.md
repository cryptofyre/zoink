# Zoink BETA
An open source game made by Fire, Jack, Allen, Ethan
## Requirements
Python 3.7 - 3.8 required.
A linux system otherwise wget errors will endure
(If you have wget installed on Windows it should work fine if you download the prerelease version for Windows.)
Currently working on a alternative to that however.
